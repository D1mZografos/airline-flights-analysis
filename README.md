## 📌 Project Summary

This project analyzes commercial flight booking data to uncover insights into airline pricing strategies, customer behavior, and route performance. Using Python for exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL for deeper querying, and Power BI for dashboard creation, this end-to-end workflow showcases how data can be transformed into business value.

### 🎯 Business Problem
Airlines face constant pressure to optimize pricing, maximize occupancy, and tailor services to customer behavior. Poor visibility into booking trends and pricing patterns can result in missed revenue and inefficient route planning.

### 💡 Project Goals
- Understand pricing variation across airlines, classes, routes, and booking timing
- Identify the most frequent and potentially profitable routes
- Analyze how flight duration and number of stops impact ticket prices
- Enable data-driven decisions for pricing, route allocation, and customer targeting

### 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Data cleaning, feature engineering, visual EDA
- **SQL**: Business queries and aggregation logic
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboards and storytelling

### 🔍 Key Skills Demonstrated
- End-to-end data pipeline from raw CSV to dashboard
- SQL query design with business context
- Data visualization and storytelling using Power BI
- GitHub project organization for public portfolios

### 📈 Outcome
The project reveals clear patterns in ticket pricing based on class, route, urgency, and number of stops. It supports decisions such as adjusting prices for high-demand routes, encouraging early bookings, and optimizing seat class availability.
