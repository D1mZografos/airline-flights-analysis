# ✈️ Airline Flights Analysis Project

A complete end-to-end data analysis project focused on Indian domestic airline flights. This project covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL queries for deeper insights, and visualization through Power BI.

---

## 📊 Project Objectives

- Understand how flight attributes affect ticket prices
- Identify trends by airline, class, route, and booking behavior
- Practice SQL query writing and Power BI dashboarding
- Showcase skills in Python, SQL, Azure, and BI tools

| Folder      | Description                                                   |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `data/`     | Contains the cleaned dataset (`cleaned_airline_data.csv`)     |
| `python/`   | Python notebook + Markdown summary of EDA                     |
| `sql/`      | Table schema + analysis queries in MySQL                   |
| `powerbi/`  | Power BI dashboard file (`.pbix`) and optional screenshots    |

## 🔍 Key Insights from EDA

- **Business class** flights are 4–5× more expensive than Economy
- **Vistara** and **Air India** are the most expensive airlines
- **Last-minute bookings (0–3 days)** have the highest average prices
- Most flights are from **Delhi**, **Mumbai**, and **Bangalore**
- **Evening and Night** flights are generally more expensive
- Top route by frequency: **Delhi ↔ Mumbai**

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **MySQL** for querying
- **Power BI** for dashboarding

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone this repo
2. Load `data/cleaned_airline_data.csv` into MySQL
3. Run SQL queries from `sql/airline_flight_queries.sql`
4. Open Power BI and connect to SQL or CSV file
5. Explore interactive dashboards

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to perform real-world EDA and feature engineering
- Writing optimized SQL queries for analysis
- Uploading data to cloud and visualizing with BI tools
- Structuring a portfolio-ready data project

---

## ✅ Future Work

- Host dashboard publicly (Power BI Service)
- Add prediction model for flight prices (ML)
